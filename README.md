# 🗂️ Portfolio Website 🗂️

Hello all, I have been wanting to work with HTML and CSS here and there for the last few years now. However, I would still say I am a beginner. I have tried really simple things just to see how some HTML and CSS elements work, but never combined enough to really make a website look. I never did that because I never had any focus to use (was never one who wanted to just copy Googles home page to practice). However, I have been dabbling with GIMP with my wife and have actually created a design that I am finally interested in making for my own website so now I will actually see what I can do with the knowledge I have and see how long this journey will take me. 
My end goal is to actually try and make this to show myself and others I know a great skill and see where this can take me. I would love to get into a job where I am programing, but realize that I will probably need to learn HTML, CSS, and JavaScript before I am even looked at by a company so I am hoping to learn all of this through this project in some ways.
Lets see where this take me and I hope that you will join me in this crazy adventure I'm about to start. Have a great day and never stop learning things. :)
